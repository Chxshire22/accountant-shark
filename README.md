a bot that helps you be a loanshark
@AccountantSharkbot on telegram.

listen. i built this over the weekend. so it's probably full of shit code. it's not modularized in different files for "separation of concerns". it doesn't cover all edge cases probably.

but it does what it should.

i forgot
as of writing this README, it's been a couple of months. you know what they say - when i wrote it, only god and i understand it. now, only god understands this.

todo
i still need help with this for the following:

currency exchange
clearer instructions, especially in private chat, since people tend to try and talk to it there. i initially had this, removed it, now i forgot where to edit to put it back but i can probably get that done with some time.
need to fix the ability to pay for and to someone outside of the groupchat. meaning, you can log payments in private chat between user and sharkbot. initially possible as well until i shut it off.
needs refactoring of code, some repeated code, need modularization and documentation

**big thanks to @xmercerweiss for the refactoring**
