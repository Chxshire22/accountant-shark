# Accountant-Shark
**@AccountantSharkbot** on telegram.
This is a fork of a Python project by [@Chxshire22](https://github.com/Chxshire22/accountant-shark) meant to streamline the bookkeeping of informal personal debts, such as those incurred as favors over the course of various casual meetups. This fork is intended as my personal standardization and revision of this project.
## TODO List
As provided by [@Chxshire22](https://github.com/Chxshire22).
- currency exchange
- clearer instructions, especially in private chat, since people tend to try and talk to it there. i initially had this, removed it, now i forgot where to edit to put it back but i can probably get that done with some time.
- need to fix the ability to pay for and to someone outside of the groupchat. meaning, you can log payments in private chat between user and sharkbot. initially possible as well until i shut it off.
- needs refactoring of code, some repeated code, need modularization and documentation
