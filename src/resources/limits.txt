I have serious limitations.

For example, telegram users can only tag their friends via usernames "eg @user1"
But usernames are not unique, and are not immutable. This means that data can be lost or corrupted if a user changes their username. 
Some users don't have a username, and are "None". I cannot operate properly if a user has "None".

Currencies - I only record in $ amounts at the moment. Currency exchange will be added in the future. 

User IDs are immutable and unique, but telegram users don't know their friends' user ID and it is not intuitive to use. 

At the moment there are syntax issues which I ignore. You can input the wrong records easily.

Expect bugs. Report them on my AccountantShark thread on https://forum.bladerunners.net
