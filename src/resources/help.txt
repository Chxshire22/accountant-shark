What do I do?  I record payments made by users, for their friends in the group chat.

Due to Telegram's security measures I need everyone participating to do /register.

Paid for or to your friend/s? - 
Send me the information in this format: '@AccountantShark I paid $89 for @user1 @user2 @user3.' or '@AccountantShark I paid $10 to @user1'
This will record the amount spent, and split it between the different users.

Got paid what you're owed? -
Send "@AccountantShark @user paid me $X" 
I'll check if they exist, owe you that much or more, then deduct it from the balance.
The debt is cleared once the debt is 0. 

Want to check your records?
Send "@AccountantShark check"

I only record in $ amounts at the moment. Currency exchange will be added in the future.
